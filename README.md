### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm [Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com)!

I'm a machine learning engineer currently working at [SynSense](https://synsense.ai/) with a PhD in neuromorphic engineering and a strong interest in open-source software. I try to build tools that are easy to use because we can all use a little less time debugging! I work with event-based cameras, spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware and love to combine the three. 

I'm looking to collaborate on machine learning theory for spiking neural networks and feel free to ask my about tooling related to event-based computing, because I've authored libraries for [camera file parsing](https://github.com/neuromorphic-paris/loris), [data wrangling](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [SNN training](https://github.com/synsense/sinabs).

It's easiest to reach me on SynSense's [Discord](https://discord.gg/V6FHBZURkg), but I'm also on [Twitter](twitter.com/gregorlenz) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorlenz/).
